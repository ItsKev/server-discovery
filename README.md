# ServerDiscovery

This plugin connects minecraft servers to a waterfall proxy within Kubernetes.

The service account in the namespace which the proxy is running in needs the privilege to read 
endpoints from the namespaces specified in the config.

## Setup
Minecraft servers are discovered by labels. The namespaces where the Minecraft servers are running in have to be
labeled with `server-discovery: "true"`. The pods which the minecraft server is running in has to be labeled with `server-discovery: "true"`
as well.

## Examples
Namespace:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: minecraft
  labels:
    server-discovery: "true"
```

Deployment:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: minecraft
  namespace: minecraft
  labels:
    app: minecraft
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: minecraft
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: minecraft
        server-discovery: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: minecraft
        image: minecraft
```

## Role and role bindings
Role in the namespace where the minecraft servers are running in:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: minecraft
  name: minecraft-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list"]
```

Corresponding role binding to the namespace where the proxy is running in:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: minecraft-role-binding
  namespace: minecraft
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: default
    namespace: proxy
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: minecraft-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

A cluster role has to be defined to list namespaces:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: namespace-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["namespaces"]
  verbs: ["list"]
```

The role binding for the cluster role could look like the following:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-namespace-global
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: default
    namespace: proxy
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: namespace-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
